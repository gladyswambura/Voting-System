## Description 
With our lives increasingly shifting online, it’s only logical that voting would transition to a digital platform too. 

E-Poll is a Simple,secure and transparent voting system. Common features include single-vote verification, which ensures members don’t inadvertently vote more than once; ballot tracking, which monitors the exact moment a ballot is processed; a secure network to protect the entire process from nominations to tabulation; and secret ballots, which keep ballots private.
